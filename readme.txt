Import your College Publisher archives into Wordpress

== Description ==

CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPEMENT. NOT READY TO USE!!!!

CP Import allows you to move your newspaper from College Publisher to Wordpress in a snap.

CP Import will import your articles, sections, authors, and media into Wordpress without you breaking a sweat.

Simply install and activate this plugin, navigate to Tools -> Import, click on "College Publisher" and follow the on screen directions,
and you'll be up an running in about an hour.

This plugin currently only supports export files from CP 4. It is untested with CP 5.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `cp_import.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to Tools -> Import -> College Publisher and follow the on-screen insturctions

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Did College Publisher write this plugin? =

No. This plugin was written by John Luetke (johnl1479) to aid in the Marquette Tribune's move from College Publisher to Wordpress. The College Media Network does not support, or endorse this plugin.

= Is this compatible with Wordpress MU? =

Yes. This plugin was developed using Wordpress MU, but does not use any MU-specific features, so it *should* be fully compatibile with Wordpress as well.

= What versions of College Publisher will this work with? =

This plugin was written using CP 4 export files. It has not been tested with CP 5 export files. If you have CP 5 export files and would like to send them to me, I will try to make this plugin compatible.

= Will this import my paper's Custom Pages? =

No, sorry.

== Acknowledgements ==

I'd like to thank Brian Schlansky for documentating the Miami Hurricane's move from CP to Wordpress. I'd have been lost without it.

Also, I'd like to thank Zack Preble and his CSV Import plugin for providing me the framework for building an importer plugin.

Lastly, Thank Wordpress, for developing such a customizable publishing platform.
